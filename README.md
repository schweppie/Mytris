Blocks is a project where aimed to have the game logic as
independent as possible from the game engine's, in this case
Unity3D, specific api.

The gamestate logic is separate from Unity 3D. The only thing that
Unity is passing through is input and visualizing the resulting game
state.

Todo: Port the game logic to plain c# console app or other engine.
